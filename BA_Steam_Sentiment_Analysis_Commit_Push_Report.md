## Push Operation Details
- **Command executed:** `git push origin main`
- **Result:** SUCCESS
- **Output:** `To https://github.com/martindao/BA_Steam_Sentiment_Analysis.git 631706c..ac0dfa0 main -> main`
- **Commits pushed:** 21 historical commits from 2019
- **No force push required:** The local history was a proper superset of remote

## Final Status
- **Local repository:** Synchronized with origin/main
- **Remote repository:** Now contains all 23 commits
- **Git status:** `## main...origin/main` (no ahead/behind)
- **Operation:** SUCCESS - No errors or warnings encountered

## Special Considerations
1. **Historical Data Recovery:** The repository contained historical commits from 2019 that were not present on the remote, suggesting this may have been a data recovery or repository import operation.

2. **No Conflict Resolution Required:** Since the local commits built upon the existing remote commits, no conflict resolution was necessary.

3. **Clean Push Operation:** The push completed without requiring force options, indicating proper git history lineage.

## Documentation
- Initial git status check confirmed 21 commits ahead
- Commit history examination revealed the 2019 origin of additional commits
- Remote comparison confirmed the commits were genuinely missing from origin
- Push operation completed successfully without complications
